  -Dataset from Paper
  -2016 Republican Presidential Election Debates

*Description of Paper:
  The study analyzes video from the 4th Republican Party presidential debate on November 10, 2016, and continuous response approval data from a live focus group consisting of 311 
  participants, totaling 36,528 reactions. The research utilizes machine learning and computer vision techniques to examine the influence of nonverbal emotional displays of 
  political candidates on voter impressions. The results indicate that anger displays by political candidates positively influence real-time viewer evaluations, whereas happiness 
  displays are less effective, and fear displays were seldom projected by the candidates. However, it is important to note that the only raw data avilable from the paper is the   
  demographics of the live focus group. 

*My Project Goals / Research Question:
  

*Code / Data Analysis Required:
  -Clustering Model using demographic dataset in order to find any trends or biases in the original study
  -New binary dataset created by thorough analysis of the 2016 debate video used in the study and its debate topics
  -New Logistic Regression model based on topics covered in the debate video
  -Possible Clustering model used on new dataset
